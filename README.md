Programming Language A
will be ported to https://github.com/alanguage/A  soon

##Goal
Assembly language with C style syntax for X86 processors with the freedom of assembly and the dense notation of the C language.
##How to run
Start the small Batch file BA.BAT. The compiler compiles itself and calls the Netwide Assembler(NASM).
##Functions
###Design
###Variables

##History
As of 1.1.2015 I set the software as free software under the MIT license.
You find a very old version from 2009 here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pla/
It includes with source compiler, command interpreter and the game [Towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

#TODO
1. write the documentation (my part)
2. mailing list
3. issues, bug tracker

##Later
1. remove the old Borland TASM code
2. I used no Version control system and printed out the code. 
So I wrote the code very dense. With the code folding features of the editors 
there is no need any more. Beautifying the code.
