###History
As of 1.1.2015 I set the software as free software under the MIT license.
You find a very old version from 2009 here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pla/
It includes with source compiler, command interpreter and the game [Towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

##TODO
* porting to https://github.com/alanguage/A, if I know how to do
* I will write the documentation
* installing a mailing list, issues tracker, I need help

###Later
* I used no Version control system and printed out the code. 
So I wrote the code very dense. With the code folding features of the editors 
there is no need any more. Beautifying the code.
* remove the old Borland TASM code
